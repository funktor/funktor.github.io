My name is Abhijit Mondal. I am a Machine Learning engineer specializing in Distributed Machine Learning, ML infra, Big Data processing, Forecasting using Deep Learning and Recommender Systems.

My area of work revolves around optimizing ML production pipelines using efficient infrastructure such as distributed ML, distributed big data processing (Spark, OpenMPI etc.), GPU and CUDA, rewriting CPU intensive workloads in C++ and Rust.

I like writing blogs and I feel that writing is one of the most efficient medium to spread knowledge and information.
