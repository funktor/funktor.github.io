Sometimes back, I was leading a project at Microsoft to build their demand and supply forecasting models for `spot virtual machines` running in Azure. The idea behind using the demand-supply forecast models is to improve the `dynamic pricing` algorithm for spot instances.

For people who are unaware of spot virtual machines, almost all cloud service providers provide them. These virtual machines comes at a `discounted price` compared to the standard virtual machines (roughly `10% to 90%` discount) but with the gotcha that these spot VMs can be evicted (read: Job killed) anytime depending on the current demand and bids. (Think like an `auction`).

An optimal pricing algorithm for these spot instances should take into account the projected demand and supply because we do not want to price these VMs too less such that the demand for these exceeds the projected supply. The exact dynamic pricing algorithm is a story for another post though.

The demand-supply forecasting deals with `700+ different virtual machines` e.g. `standard_d16s_v5`, running across `100+ regions` and running either `linux or windows` OS. Thus, there are approx. 700 * 100 * 2 = `140K` different time series for demand as well as supply forecasting or `280K` in total considering both demand and supply together.
